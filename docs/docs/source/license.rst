The MIT License

The MIT License is a permissive free software license originating at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
 As a permissive license, it puts only very limited restriction on reuse and has, therefore, an excellent license compatibility.
 The MIT license permits reuse within proprietary software provided that all copies of the licensed software include a copy of the MIT License terms and the copyright notice.
