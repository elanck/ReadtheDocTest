Read the Docs Introduction page
===============================

Read the Docs hosts documentation for the open source community. We support Sphinx docs written with reStructuredText and CommonMark. We pull your code from your Subversion, Bazaar, Git, and Mercurial repositories. Then we build documentation and host it for you. Think of it as Continuous Documentation

Heading 2:

You can add any Git repository to GitHub Desktop, even if it's not a GitHub repository.
